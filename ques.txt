Your program will have a 3x3 array. The user will input the sum of each row and each column. Then the user will input 3 values and store them anywhere, or any location or index, temporarily in the array. Your program will supply the remaining six (6) values and determine the exact location of each value in the array.
Example:
Input: Sum of row 1: 6
Sum of row 2: 15
Sum of row 3: 24
Sum of column 1: 12
Sum of column 2: 15
Sum of column 3: 18
Value 1: 3
Value 2: 5
Value 3: 6

Output: Sum of Row
1 2 3 6
4 5 6 15
7 8 9 24
Sum of column
12 15 18
Note: Your program will not necessary sort the values in the array.
